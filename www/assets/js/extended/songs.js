                1: "Am I a soldier of the cross,a foll'wer of the Lamb,and shall I fear to own His cause,or blush to speak His name?",
                2: "Must I be carried to the skies on flow'ry beds of ease,while others fought to win the prize,and sailed thro' bloody seas?",
                3: "Are there no foes for me to face?Must I not stem the flood?Is this vile world a friend to grace,to help me on to God?",
                4: "Sure I must fight, if I would reign;increase my courage, Lord!I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,supported by Thy word.",
                5: "The saints in all this glorious war shall conquer, though they die;they see the triumph from afar by faith's discerning eye.",
                6: "When that illustrious day shall rise,and all Thine armies shine in robes of vict'ry thro' the skies,the glory shall be Thine."
